# Space Race (Dating App)

A web application built for learning purposes -- follows the Udemy tutorial [Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/learn/v4/content). 

Space Race is intended to be like a dating site where users can try to find matching partners, but with an "outer space" theme.

While the server follows the tutorial 100%, the client application deviates from the tutorial by using Angular 6 instead of 5, and by implement NGRX for state management. The complete tech stack and tools used are as follows:
